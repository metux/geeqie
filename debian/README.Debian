Geeqie for Debian
-----------------

Upstream lost interest in GQview and new authors took over the code from
GQview and continued to develop it under new name Geeqie. This is reason
(together with fact that nobody was willing to maintain gqview package in
Debian) for Geeqie replacing GQview in Debian.

Package is maintained in collab-maint repository and you're welcome to
join us.
